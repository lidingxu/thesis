I am profoundly indebted to my supervisors, Leo Liberti, Claudia D’Ambrosio, and Sonia Haddad-Vanier for their unwavering support, guidance, and mentorship throughout my doctoral journey. Their expertise and encouragement have been invaluable.
Additionally, this endeavor would not have been possible without the generous support from École doctorale IP Paris and the French taxpayers, who financed my research.

Words cannot express my gratitude to my defense committee. I could not have undertaken this journey without my defense committee, who generously provided knowledge and expertise.

I am also grateful to my colleagues for their discussion and inspiration. Thanks should also go to the administrative staff who helped me a lot with administration issues.

Lastly, I should mention my family, especially my parents. Their belief in me has kept my spirits and motivation high during this process. I would also like to thank my girlfriend for all the emotional support.
